# [CVE-2024-40091](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40091): No Authentication in Boa Webserver
* **CVSS Score** - 5.3, Medium ([CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N))
* **Overview** - the custom TCP service running on port 5432 has several functions, one of which includes spinning up a webserver stored at `/hualai/boa/boa` on port 8023. Since this service has no authentication, anyone can spin up the webserver. However, even if port 5432 enforced authentication and authorization, once the Boa webserver on port 8023 is opened up, anyone on the LAN can interact with it and retrieve the logs.
* **Description**
    * The entire purpose of this Boa webserver is to expose a user-accessible interface for retrieving log files to send to Vilo customer support.
    * The webserver is not accessible by default, but can be spun up and exposed. Once the webserver is exposed, anyone on the LAN has access to this log file and can use the hard-coded decryption key to recover the original logs and see internal router information.
    * Enforcing authentication on this endpoint would ensure that only those who should have access to those logs can actually access them.
* **Steps to Reproduce**
    * Regularly scan port 8023 on the router. 
    * When the webserver is accessible, go to `https://<ip>:8023/` and click on the link for the log file.
    * To decrypt the log, use a repeating key of `\xf0\xfa\x22\x03` and XOR it with the bytes.
* **Impact** - If the Boa webserver is already exposed on port 8023, anyone can retrieve the logs and see confidential, internal information like process lists, MAC addresses, MQTT logs, WiFi information, etc.
